# Linked_Data_Semantic_Web_Project

###Daniel Maloney

##Scope:
The API will allow the user to compare the data between two data sets. 
The first data set is a public census taken for the years 2006 and 2011 in four major cities 
in Ireland (Galway, Limerick, Dublin and Cork). The second data set contains crime activity during
the corresponding years (2006 and 2011) in each of these four cities. The idea of which is to
draw comparrissons with the increase of population in a city and the increase of crime rate within that city, 
as well as the severity of the crime.

##Data Sets Used:
###CJQ03:Population by Sex, Province or County and CensusYear

###CDD01:Recorded Crime Offences by Garda Division, Type of Offence and Quarter
